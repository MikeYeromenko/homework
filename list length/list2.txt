In this article, you'll learn about functions; what is a function, the syntax, components and types of a function. Also, you'll learn to create a function in Python.
What is a function in Python?

In Python, function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.

Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes code reusable.
Syntax of Function

def function_name(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statement(s)

Above shown is a function definition which consists of following components.

    Keyword def marks the start of function header.
    A function name to uniquely identify it. Function naming follows the same rules of writing identifiers in Python.
    Parameters (arguments) through which we pass values to a function. They are optional.
    A colon (:) to mark the end of function header.
    Optional documentation string (docstring) to describe what the function does.
    One or more valid python statements that make up the function body. Statements must have same indentation level (usually 4 spaces).
    An optional return statement to return a value from the function.
